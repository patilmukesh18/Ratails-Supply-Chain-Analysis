How to start Analysis

Ask Question to stakeholders

- Who will use my report?
- What problems are they looking to solve with my report?

Comedian Ricky Gervais once said: *“If you try to please everyone, you’ll please no one”,* and this adage is especially true in data visualization. Different users will focus on different data in your report, so you can cater to their needs specifically by removing irrelevant data and highlighting the most important visuals with size, color, or placement.

### So, **find out who will use your report the most**

and have a chat with them about what data is the most important to them, what answers they are looking for and what are their design and UI preferences (such as touch input, specific visuals, etc.). Once you’ve done that, you can start designing your report and look for the best ways to provide answers they’re looking for.

## **Top 3 Tips for Creating a Retail & Supply Chain Report**

### **Tip #1: Choose Your Data Carefully**

Your screen space is limited, which means that every pixel on a report page must count. Each visual or other report must serve the same goal – **building a cohesive data narrative and providing value to the user**.

### **Tip #2: Use the Correct Visuals for Your Data**

### **Tip #3: Focus on Usability**

This is what determines if your report will be something that the user reluctantly browses for a bit and then puts away, or actively explores before making each decision. You, obviously, want the latter, which is why your reports must make a good first impression and provide a consistently great user experience that doesn’t distract the user with any frustrations or annoyances.

### Key Takeaways

- Carefully plan and research before designing the data model and creating the report itself.
- Talk to your main report users to gain insights on what answers are important to them.
- Create reports that provide great user experience and caters to the users’ needs.
In short, **Retail Analytics** focuses on customer-facing metrics and the performance of products in the retail environment, while **Supply Chain Analytics** focuses on the operational side of product movement, ensuring that products are efficiently sourced, manufactured, and delivered.
